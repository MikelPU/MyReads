# MyReads
This is the final project from the React Fundamentals section, called MyReads, included in the Udacity's Nanodegree course.

It consists in a React app to sort a bunch of books depending our tastes.
The books can be sorted through 4 different filters -->  Want To Read, Read, Currently Reading and None.
Depending the option chosen, the books must be (re)allocated into the right Shelf.
These shelves are themshelves allocated into a virtual Bookshelf.

In order to fetch the books, a Search Screen is implemented. This view supports filtering by certain words while the books are displayed.
